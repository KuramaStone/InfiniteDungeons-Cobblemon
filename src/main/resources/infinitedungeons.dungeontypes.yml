# FightOrFlight was (will be) updated in v1.1.2 to have an "aggression-bias" property.
#  - This can be used to make pokemon more aggressive - typically -5 would guarantee aggression and +5 guarantees fleeing.

Types:
  # This is an example entry that explains each entry.
  example:
    # These properties are applied at the end of every specific entry. For example, the first entry here would become "bulbasaur lvl=25" when spawning the boss.
    base-properties: "lvl=25"
    # This is the list of possible bosses that can spawn here. Use weights to control how likely they are to spawn
    spawn-list:
      - properties: "pikachu" # This is used to build the pokemon and works like /pokegive
        weight: 100.0 # More weight = More likely to be picked.

  # This example uses formulas to make it grow increasingly difficult
  advanced:
    # You can write a formula such as ${1+1} to get 2. Text in this format will be calculated before building the pokemon
    # "lvl=${1+1}" turns into "lvl=2"
    # There are some variables built-in:
    # - {config_id}: The config_id of the current dungeon.
    # - {avg_times_completed}: The number of times this dungeon has been beaten on average for this DungeonTeam
    # - {max_times_completed}: The number of times this dungeon has been beaten by the highest value team member
    # - {team_size}: The size of the player team in the dungeon
    # Some tools that can help you are:
    # - abs(x): Absolute value
    # - floor(x): Drops the value to the lower whole number (if not already a whole number)
    # - round(x): Rounds the number to the closest whole number
    # - ceil(x): Raises the value to the higher whole number (if not already a whole number)
    # - min(x, y): Returns the lower value between the two
    # - max(x, y): Returns the higher value between the two

    # This example showcases a level that raises by 5 for each avg_times_completed AND causes higher aggression based on the max_times_completed divided by 5. baseLevel is a variable provided by the parent Dungeon config located in /dungeons.yml
