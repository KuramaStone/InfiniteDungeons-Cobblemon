# Dungeon Minigame Mod

This mod adds a configurable dungeon-based minigame to Minecraft. Players form teams, enter temporary dungeon instances, fight through challenges, and face a customizable boss Pok√©mon. The system is built around flexible configuration and strong safety controls for multiplayer servers.

# Features

### Entering Dungeons
- Players can enter a dungeon via command or via gui.
- Teams enter dungeons together. Teams may be a single player or multiple players.
- Before entry, each team member receives a confirmation menu/message with a 15s timer. Only confirmed players are sent into the dungeon.
- Players can only access dungeons the teamleader has permission to. Team owners can bring teammates without that permission. Permissions can be granted via `infinitedungeons.dungeons.<dungeon config id>`

### Minigame Details
- Each dungeon instance is generated in a temporary dimension using Roguelike Dungeons.
- A configurable Boss Pok√©mon spawns in the lowest valid preferred room.
- Chunks outside of the dungeon do not generate.
- Players spawn in the **Jukebox Room**, or in a random room if unavailable.
- Loot is **per-player**: each chest shows unique contents for each participant.
- Players have limited lives:
    - On death, they keep their inventory and respawn at the starting room.
    - When out of lives, players switch to spectator mode within the dungeon.
    - Spectators follow their closest living teammate if possible.
- Once all players run out of lives, the dungeon ends and the temporary world is deleted.
- End conditions:
    - Defeat the Boss Pok√©mon
    - All players lose their remaining lives

### Teams
- Teams are persistent across saves and have a configurable maximum size.
- Players can only be a member of one team at a time.
- Team ownership:
    - Owners can invite or kick members.
    - Owners must transfer ownership or disband the team before leaving.
- Invitations are required to join a team.
- Not every member must enter a dungeon. Those who decline are excluded for that run.

### Safety
- Dungeon dimensions are **temporary** and never saved to disk.
- Only confirmed team members can teleport into their dungeon instance.
- Non-members cannot teleport into a dungeon unless they are in creative or have operator permissions. A clear message explains the exception.
- Players automatically return to their original gamemode when leaving the dungeon world.
